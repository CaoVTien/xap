 * Extends the {@link IRedoLogFileStorage} interface by adding a non batch behavior of adding

 * one packet which will be used for buffering of packets addition without the need to actually
 * support a single packet addition it in the storage provider
 *
 * Implementor should support concurrent readers or a single writer, in other words, the implementor
 * can assume access to this structure are guarded with a reader writer lock according to the
 * operation type
